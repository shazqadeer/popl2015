\section{Experience}
\label{sec:experience}

The \civl verifier has been under development for around two years.  
Over that period, we have developed a collection of 32 benchmarks, 
ranging in size from 17 to 539 LOC, to illustrate various features of
\civl and for regression testing as we evolved the verifier.
In addition to microbenchmarks, this collection also includes
standard benchmarks from the literature such as a multiset implementation~\cite{ElmasTQ05}, 
the ticket algorithm~\cite{FarzanKP14}, 
Treiber stack~\cite{Herlihy2008}, work-stealing queue~\cite{Blumofe1999},
device cache~\cite{ElmasQT09}, and lock-protected increment~\cite{FlanaganQ03}. 
The \civl verifier is fast; the entire benchmark set verifies in 20 seconds on a standard 4-core Windows PC (2.8GHz, 8GB)
with no benchmark requiring more than a few seconds.

\subsection{Garbage collector}
We have used \civl to design and verify a realistic concurrent mark-sweep garbage collection (GC) algorithm.  
In particular, although our algorithm is based on an earlier algorithm by Dijkstra et al~\cite{dijk78}, 
it extends the earlier algorithm with various modern optimizations and embellishments to improve generality and performance.  
These extensions include lower write barrier overhead, phase-based synchronization and handshaking, 
and coordination between the GC and mutator threads during root scanning; our use of linearity aids the proof of root scanning, 
while our rely-guarantee encoding aids management of colors inside the write barrier
(which is similar to the barrier in Section~\ref{sec:overview}).
Furthermore, our encoding of the algorithm in \civl spans a wide range of abstraction, 
from low-level memory operations all the way up to high-level specifications; 
we used six layers of refinement to help hide low-level details from the high-level portions of the verification.
We believe that \civl's combination of features makes practical, for the first time, verification across such a wide range of abstraction.

\civl's support for refinement allows us to write concise specifications of the garbage collector's correctness:
to be correct, the GC must implement Allocate, ReadField, and WriteField actions that appear to act atomically,
even though in the underlying implementation,
these operations execute concurrently with the garbage collector thread and with other program threads.
The specification states that Allocate atomically adds new objects to the heap,
while ReadField and WriteField read and write fields from heap objects.
Although the garbage collector's Mark and Sweep code constitutes the bulk of the GC code,
they are hidden in the high-level specification;
they have detailed correctness specifications in the middle layers of the proof,
but the most important point at the high level is that their work not interfere with Allocate, ReadField, and WriteField.
In particular, Mark must coordinate with WriteField's write barrier,
and Sweep must not remove any objects that are still reachable by ReadField and WriteField.

Overall, our GC implementation consists of about 2100 lines of Boogie code.
The verification takes 60 seconds on the same PC used for microbenchmarks.
The bulk of this time, 54 seconds, is taken by the verification of the two judgments,
$\Refines;\HiddenProcs;\HiddenVars;\bs{b} \jr \Prog$ and $\InterferenceSafe(\Prog)$, described in Section~\ref{sec:verification}.
The checks for linear variables, yield sufficiency, and commutativity take the rest of the time and are insignificant in comparison.

\subsection{Discussion}
The GC verification demonstrates that stepwise refinement using \civl is a
powerful verification approach. 
Another important lesson learned from the GC proof is that a collection
of techniques is needed to support stepwise refinement, and a different blend of
techniques best serves the verification goals at different layers of refinement. 
We now expand on this point. 

The primary purpose of the lower layers of the GC proof was to enable
reasoning with coarser atomic actions at higher layers. 
Reduction was the primary proof method used in these layers, where
concurrent data structures and synchronization primitives were proven
to implement atomic operations on them correctly. 

At the top few layers of the GC proof, invariant-based
non-interference reasoning was our primary tool. 
This reasoning was made simpler on a program with coarser
atomic actions. 
We observed that the use
of location invariants made the certain layers of the proof more
manageable as compared to an earlier effort where we used
rely-guarantee reasoning and auxiliary variables to reason about
non-interference.  

Linear variables were used throughout the proof to model the distinct
thread identifiers for the garbage collector thread and mutator
threads, but were most instrumental in encoding single-threaded
execution in the initialization phase of the program.  
Variable hiding was used throughout the proof. 

Our experience with the GC verification indicates that 
\civl's capability to use multiple verification techniques, soundly and cooperatively, is very valuable.
