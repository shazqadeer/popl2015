Our tool \civl has been implemented as a conservative extension to the \boogie verifier~\cite{BarnettCDJL05}. 

\boogie and \civl have been installed on the {\tt CAV\_AE.ova} virtual machine. The file {\tt CAV\_AE\_75.ova} at the following link has \civl and all of the other software it depends on installed. Please follow the instructions in {\tt ~/README.txt} to run the benchmarks. These instructions are repeated below for your convenience. 

The \boogie codebase includes a directory named {\tt Test} which contains verification benchmarks in several directories. The collection of 32 benchmarks referred to in Section~7 of our paper, and the \civl file containing the concurrent garbage collector descriptions and proof ({\tt GC.bpl}) reside in the directory {\tt Test/civl}. To have \civl re-verify these benchmarks, run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/boogie/Test/civl
lit .
\end{verbatim} 

To run \civl only on a particular benchmark, e.g., on {\tt GC.bpl} do the following

\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/boogie/Test/civl
lit GC.bpl
\end{verbatim} 

For each benchmark, the expected output of \civl is contained in a file with a {\tt bpl.expect} extension, e.g., {\tt GC.bpl.expect}. 

\civl itself can be downloaded from the following URL:

The standard benchmarks from the literature referred to in Section~7 are included in the following files:
\begin{itemize}
\item a multiset implementation~\cite{ElmasTQ05}: {\tt multiset.bpl}
\item the ticket algorithm~\cite{FarzanKP14}: {\tt ticket.bpl}
\item Treiber stack~\cite{Herlihy2008}: {\tt treiber-stack.bpl}
\item a work-stealing queue~\cite{Blumofe1999}: {\tt wsq.bpl}
\item a device cache~\cite{ElmasQT09}: {\tt DeviceCache.bpl}
\item lock-protected increment~\cite{FlanaganQ03}: {\tt par-incr.bpl}
\end{itemize}

The following technical report~\cite{gc-techreport} contains a more in-depth explanation of the language features and usage of \civl, the theory and formalism behind \civl, and a description of the concurrent garbage collector and its proof.

The language and verification features of \civl are illustrated in Section~6.1 of this technical report through a sequence of example programs (Figures~13-18, Programs1-5). The \civl files for these examples are {\tt ~/boogie/Test/civl/\-Program1.bpl} through {\tt ~/boogie/Test/civl/Program5.bpl}.
