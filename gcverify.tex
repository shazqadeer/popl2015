\subsection{Collector Verification in Boogie}

We have implemented and verified our algorithm in Boogie,
including initialization (Initialize), the GC (GarbageCollect), the allocator (Alloc),
and the mutator operations (ReadField, WriteField, and Eq, which tests for pointer equality),
and all the lower-level operations required to implement them (some of which appear
in Figure~\ref{fig:VerifiedGC}, but most of which are omitted from the figure to save space).
To make the verification as realistic as possible,
our Boogie code implements everything in terms of individual CPU operations,
such as load, store, atomic increment/decrement, and CAS (compare-and-swap);
in contrast to some previous work~\cite{gont96},
we do not assume any built-in higher level operations.
To ease verification, we make some simplifications:
we use a naive allocator (sequential search for free space),
we assume a sequentially consistent memory model,
and we assume that all objects have the same number of fields.
(Except for the assumption of sequential consistency, none of these substantially alters the nature of the proof.)
