We present an overview of the \civl language and verifier through a sequence of examples.
Figure~\ref{fig:ex1} shows Program~1 containing a procedure {\tt p}
executing concurrently with another procedure {\tt q}. 
An execution of a \civl program is non-preemptive; a thread explicitly yields control to the
scheduler via the {\tt yield} statement following which execution continues on a 
nondeterministically chosen thread.
The {\tt yield} statement has an assertion $\varphi$ attached to it.
The yielding thread must establish $\varphi$ when it yields and the execution of other threads 
must preserve $\varphi$; these two requirements in Owicki-Gries-style
reasoning~\cite{OwickiG76} are usually known as {\em sequential correctness}
and {\em non-interference}, respectively.
To check these requirements, the \civl verifier creates verification conditions, whose number is at most
quadratic in the number of yield statements in the program.
For example, in Program~1 each yield predicate in {\tt p} must be checked against the action 
{\tt x := x + 3} in {\tt q}.

{\bf From quadratic to linear verification conditions.}
Figure~\ref{fig:ex2} shows Program~2, a variation of Program~1 in which the procedure {\tt yield\_x} 
contains a single yield statement and {\tt p} calls {\tt yield\_x} instead of yielding directly.
If the calls to {\tt yield\_x} are inlined in Program~2, then we will get Program~1.
Both Program~1 and~2 are verifiable in \civl but the cost of verifying Program~2 is less because it has fewer yield statements.
In fact, if it is possible to capture all interference in a concurrent program in a single yield predicate, 
then the trick in Program~2 can be used to verify the program with a linear number of verification conditions.

{\bf Encoding rely-guarantee specifications.}
Figure~\ref{fig:ex3} shows Program~3, yet another variation of Programs~1 and~2 which shows how to encode a rely-guarantee-style~\cite{Jones83} (two-state invariant)
proof using \civl's one-state yield statements. 
The standard rely-guarantee specification to prove the assertions in {\tt p} is that the environment of {\tt p} 
may only increase {\tt x}.
We can encode this in \civl by factoring out the yield statement in a separate procedure
and then referring {\tt old(x)}, the value of {\tt x} when {\tt yield\_x} is
entered.

{

  yield t == a[tid];
  a[tid] := t + 1;
}
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Program 4}

\end{figure}

{\bf Linear variables.}
Program~4 in Figure~\ref{fig:ex5} introduces linear variables, a feature of \civl 
that is useful for encoding disjointness among values contained in 
different variables.  
This example uses this feature for encoding the concept of an identifier 
that is unique to each thread.
Program~4 contains a shared global array {\tt a} indexed by an uninterpreted type {\tt Tid} 
representing the set of thread identifiers.
A collection of threads are executing procedure {\tt P} concurrently.
The identifier of the thread executing {\tt P} is passed in as the parameter {\tt tid}.
A thread with identifier {\tt tid} owns {\tt a[tid]} and can increment it without danger of interference.
The yield assertion {\tt t == a[tid]} in {\tt P} indicates this expectation, yet it is not possible to prove it 
unless the reasoning engine knows that the value of {\tt tid} in one thread is distinct 
its value in a different thread.

Instead of building a notion of thread identifiers into \civl, we provide a more 
primitive and general notion of linear variables.
The \civl type system ensures that values contained in linear variables cannot be duplicated.
Consequently, the parameter {\tt tid} of distinct concurrent calls to {\tt P} are known to be distinct;
the \civl verifier exploits this invariant while checking for non-interference.

{\bf Refinement.} 
\civl supports the verification of refinement of atomic action specifications for
procedures. Program 5 in Figure~\ref{fig:reft} introduces refinement in \civl. 
Atomic action specifications are shown in square brackets. 
In a refinement (or abstraction) step, implementations of procedures with atomic action
specifications are replaced by the atomic actions, some variables may
be hidden, and a higher-level program is obtained. 

Program 5 is a simplified version of a pattern in our GC.
Mutator threads entering a write barrier for an
address \exC{addr} check
if the global variable \exC{Color[addr]} is \exC{WHITE()}
and set it to \exC{GRAY()}, indicating that the object at this address
and objects reachable from it should not be garbage collected. The
top-level refinement task in this example is to show that \exC{TopWB}
refines its atomic action specification 
\begin{verbatim}
  [if (Color[addr] == WHT()) Color[addr] := GRY();]
\end{verbatim}
assuming that the procedure it calls, \exC{MidWB}, satisfies its
atomic action specification. \exC{TopWB} and \exC{MidWB} have the same atomic
specification.  \exC{MidWB} is lock protected but \exC{TopWB} contains a
performance optimization. 
To avoid the cost of locking for each
address encountered, 
\exC{TopWB} only calls the expensive 
\exC{MidWB} after reading \exC{Color[addr]} without holding a lock
and confirming that it is {\tt WHITE()}.


The correctness of this
optimization is not obvious. Consider the following potential
scenario. \exC{TopWB}, not holding a lock, reads {\tt Color[addr]} and
sets \exC{cNoLock} to \exC{GRAY()} and then yields at
\exC{YieldColorsGetDarker}. Another thread sets {\tt Color[addr]} to
{\tt WHITE()}. \exC{TopWB} resumes, but does nothing and exits,
because \exC{cNoLock} is \exC{GRAY()}. In this scenario, the atomic action
specification of \exC{TopWB} would not be satisfied. However, in the GC this
scenario is not possible. 
The yield
predicate in {\tt YieldColorsOnlyGetDarker()} expresses the fact that
other threads in the environment of the thread running \exC{TopWB} can
only modify {\tt Color[addr]} to a higher (darker)
value. \civl verifies that this is the case. 

Given the correct
modeling of the environment interference by a yield predicate,
\civl then verifies that, for every control path through \exC{TopWB}
procedure, exactly one {\tt yield}-to-{\tt yield} execution
fragment implements the atomic action spec and that other fragments do not modify
global state. The verification of atomicity for \exC{TopWB} and
\exC{MidWB}, explained next, highlight a
novel verification feature in \civl -- that of combining
rely-guarantee reasoning and reduction to verify refinement.

The verification of \exC{MidWB} refining its atomic specification
builds on other refinement proofs (not shown) in which \civl has
verified that the implementations of the procedures called in
\exC{MidWB} refine their atomic action specifications (shown at the
bottom of the figure.) Verification of atomicity refinement for
\exC{MidWB} illustrates two key features of \civl discussed next. 

{\bf Yield Elimination.} Observe that in 
\exC{MidWB} there are no {\tt yield}s between
statements. Since threds explicitly yield control, this means that the
entire body of \exC{MidWB} is executed atomically. In
a real execution, control can switch between threads at any point in
the code. The absence of {\tt yield}s is justified by reasoning about
mover types and reduction. The procedures called in
\exC{MidWB} have the mover types claimed in their
declarations and verified by \civl. Given the mover types of all
statements, a ``yield sufficiency
checker'' in the \civl verifier ensures
that the absence of yields is justified using reduction.  \civl
then verifies that the body of \exC{MidWB} satisfies
its atomic specification. Yield elimination is useful both for the
user, since no yield predicates need to be provided, and for \civl,
as no predicates need to be checked for sequential correctness and
non-interference.

{\bf Variable Hiding.} The atomic action specification of \exC{MidWB}
makes no reference to the lock variable, although its implementation
involves a lock. When verifying refinement for \exC{MidWB}, the lock
variable has been hidden. Hiding variables at refinement steps and
providing different {\tt yield} predicates at different phases of a
proof are important novel proof organization capabilities in \civl
that facilitate proofs that span large abstraction gaps.
