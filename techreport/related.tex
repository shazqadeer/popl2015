\label{sec:related}

In this section, we discuss related work on verification of concurrent systems.
We first discuss approaches based on refinement and later approaches more directly inspired 
by Floyd-Hoare reasoning.

A generic, widely-applicable approach to specifying and verifying refinement for shared-memory concurrent software is lacking. 
%For many systems, a natural way to write a full functional specification is to provide a description of the entire system at an abstract level. 
%Checking refinement in this context is a means for full functional verification. 
%Alternatively, a series of increasingly more abstract models of a system can be used to reduce the computational cost of verifying safety properties, since safety properties of higher-level models are preserved by lower-level models. 
%This use of refinement is complementary to other techniques that combat the difficulty of verification, such as Floyd-Hoare, rely-guarantee, separation logic for modularity. 

{\bf Refinement-oriented verification.}
Atomic action specifications have been explored by the
Calvin~\cite{FlanaganFQS05} verifier previously. 
Three design choices and features make \civl better suited for
carrying out a stepwise refinement proof of a realistic program
through several layers of abstraction as in our garbage collector
proof. 
First, \civl makes a distinction between preemptive and cooperative
semantics, and carries out refinement verification on a procedure body
with cooperative semantics as enabled by movers types and reduction. 
Calvin attempts to verify refinement directly on the preemptive semantics.
Second, Calvin does not support location invariants and linear variables. 
It instead requires that a two-state rely predicate modeling all possible
interference on the shared state by other threads be supplied. 
A rely predicate that is valid at each interleaving point in
preemptive semantics is difficult to construct. 
The ability to reason on cooperative semantics using location-specific
annotations lowers the complexity of annotations required for the refinement proof.
Third, \civl, unlike Calvin, supports variable hiding. Variable hiding
is an important capability when relating multiple versions of a
program at different levels of abstraction. In our gargabe collector
proof, the top-level description hides almost all implementation
variables to provide an idealized interface to application threads. 

Reduction has been used for program simplification by the
QED~\cite{ElmasQT09} verifier.
Like \civl and Calvin, QED can verify atomicity of procedures. However,
the only method to do so in QED is transforming the procedure body
into a single (yield-free) atomic action using abstraction and reduction. \civl's
support for verifying an atomic specification for a procedure subsumes
QED's but is more general. Most importantly, \civl is able to verify
an atomic specification for a procedure body that is not atomic (has
yields) and is able to leverage location invariants and linear
variables for atomicity
refinement verification as was illustrated in the write barrier
example in Section~\ref{}. QED does not support location invariants and linear variables. 

Another key distinction between \civl and QED is the fact that a proof step in QED is a small rewrite in the concurrent program
that must be justified by potentially expensive reduction and invariant reasoning.
The number of these small proof steps directly affect both programmer
and computer effort. 
By contrast, \civl supports large proof steps, in each of which the bodies of several procedures
are automatically replaced by atomic actions, thereby lowering the cost of both interaction and automation.
In QED, abstract versions of a program are obtained by transforming the initial
version by applying a proof script. 
This makes it difficult to organize a proof in QED by providing a
description of a program at several different levels of abstraction. 
The input to \civl is a single file that correlates several different
representations of the same program at different levels of
abstraction. 
The increased scalability and usability of \civl is key to the construction of proofs spanning a large abstraction gap
between specification and implementation, as is demonstrated by our
garbage collector case study. 

This paragraph needs to be improved.
TLA+~\cite{Lamport2004} has been used for performing refinement proofs between implementations and specifications of protocols.
TLA+ drops down to logic but proofs are tedious and do not scale because of lack of software structuring.

We need a paragraph on refinement proofs in hardware, citing use of SMV~\cite{McMillan00} to verify protocol processor~\cite{Eiriksson2000} 
and Mocha~\cite{AlurHMQRT98} verification of VGI processor~\cite{Henzinger1999}.

Examples are approaches to
checking linearizability of concurrent data
structures~\cite{tacasLin,aliLin}, 
verifying correctness of
concurrent data structure implementations assuming that a certain
ownership discipline is followed~\cite{TuronM11} 

A rely-guarantee rule for simulation proofs between a source and
target programs. 
Thread-modular, nothing about procedure modular, 
Rely-guarantee, manual, separation logic, justify concurrent optimizations
many manual proofs of garbage collectors (e.g.,~\cite{LiangRGSim}). 


{\bf Other approaches.}

Overview of what ``other approaches'' means: There is a single
program, or a concurrent object and its method specification. Methods
help combat complexity and structuring of proof on this flat
description. These approaches are *complementary* to what we do.

VCC~\cite{VCC} is a tool for verifying concurrent C programs.  
Chalice~\cite{LM09} is a language and modular verification tool for concurrent programs. 
VCC does not support refinement and Chalice does so only for sequential programs;
unlike these tools, \civl is designed to verify refinement for concurrent programs.  
VCC and Chalice base their invariant reasoning on objects, object ownership, and type invariants. 
Invariant reasoning in \civl is more primitive and based on assertions in yield statements. 
Although the approach in VCC and Chalice is more convenient when applicable, \civl's approach is more flexible. 
VCC and Chalice can reason sequentially about objects exclusively owned by a thread;
\civl accomplishes the same using linear variables.
Neither VCC nor Chalice support movers and reduction reasoning.

Concurrent separation logic~\cite{OHearn07} reasons about concurrency without 
explicitly checking for non-interference between threads. 
Recently, tools based on this logic that blend in explicit non-interference reasoning have been developed~\cite{SAGL,RGSep}. 
\civl's combination of interference checking and linear variables is an extreme example of this trend,
supplying very primitive abstractions and letting programmers mix and match these abstractions freely.

Is there any other POPL-style work that needs to be cited?


%% A key challenge in specifying and verifying multi-threaded software, differently from sequential software, is that procedures do not provide a clean factoring of a program into modules. 
%% For sequential software, in the popular software verification approach based on the method of Floyd~\cite{Floyd67} and Hoare~\cite{Hoare69}, 
%% the verification of a large software component is performed modularly by verifying each procedure in it separately.
%% This modularity is enabled by the use of interface specifications (preconditions and postconditions) constraining the behavior of each procedure.
%% It is well-known that the Floyd-Hoare method is difficult to generalize to reasoning about concurrent shared-memory programs,
%% primarily because the execution of a procedure may be interfered with by concurrently executing threads.
%% Several attempts have been made to extend Floyd-Hoare reasoning to deal with concurrent interference, 
%% including classical approaches such as location invariants~\cite{Ashcroft75,OwickiG76} and rely-guarantee~\cite{Jones83},
%% and other more recent approaches~\cite{OHearn07,RGSep}. 
%% In this paper, our goal is orthogonal and complementary to these approaches to combating the complexity of verifying safety properties.
%% We provide a methodology in which the {\em refinement} problem can be stated in a modular way guided by the syntactic structure of the program as in the Floyd-Hoare method. 
%% We check refinement by reasoning about the code of a single procedure at a time, in fact, one interference-free step of the implementation at a time.
