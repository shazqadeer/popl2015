\subsection{Garbage collector}
This combination of techniques helps manage the complexity of our verification of a realistic GC algorithm.  
In particular, although our algorithm is based on an earlier algorithm by Dijkstra et al~\cite{dijk78}, 
it extends the earlier algorithm with various modern optimizations and embellishments to improve generality and performance.  
These extensions include lower write barrier overhead, phase-based synchronization and handshaking, 
and coordination between the GC and mutator threads during root scanning; our use of linearity aids the proof of root scanning, 
while our rely-guarantee encoding aids management of colors inside the write barrier.  
Furthermore, our encoding of the algorithm in \civl spans a wide range of abstraction, 
from low-level memory operations all the way up to high-level specifications; 
we used six levels of refinement to help hide low-level details from the high-level portions of the verification.
We believe that \civl's combination of features makes practical, for the first time, verification across such a wide range of abstraction.
